# Algorithms

Our purpose is to emphasize the following themes:
- Good algorithms can make the difference between being able to solve a practical problem and not being able to address it at all.
- An efficient algorithm can be as simple to code as an inefficient one.
- Understanding the performance characteristics of implementation can be an interesting and satisfying intellectual challenge.
- The scientific method is an important tool in helping us choose among different methods for solving the same problem.
